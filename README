Source code from the Ludum Dare game Greed Wars.
Wrote this in 3 days, some parts of the code were a bit rushed, but the core of the game structure is pretty nicely done.

Keep in mind the game was done in Flash IDE; all graphics and sounds are in it (I'm only sharing the code atm).
And I've also used greensock library for some GUI elements.
